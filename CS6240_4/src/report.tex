The following file is generated by analysis of the given dataset:\\

\catcode`\^^M\active
\let ^^M\par%
\input{analysis}%

\iffalse
\begin{python}%
print r"Hello"
with open("analysis", "r") as fd:
	for line in fd:
		print(line[:-1])
\end{python}%
\fi


where,\\
flight\_time and distance are the Residual standard error\\
slope\_flight\_time and slope\_distance are the slopes\\

Is distance traveled or flight time a better variable? Why?\\
Distance\\
\textbf{Reason:}\\
Residual standard error is the square-root of the mean square error (MSE).\\
Lesser the Residual standard error better the fit.\\
After observing the Residual standard error for all the airlines, we found that distance is a 
better variable than time because distance has less Residual standard error for all airlines as 
compared to time.\\

Which airline is cheapest?\\
F9 is the cheapest airline.
\textbf{Reason:}\\
Cheapest airline depends on two criterion. 1) Slope of line. 2) Intercept at y-axis
So, airline which has the least slope and less intercept will be the cheapest. 
After seeing graphs for all the airlines we conluded that F9 has the least slope and also the low y-intercept.
